I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge, UK.

My research is developing AI techniques for human-like computing. My work focuses on how people solve problems using informal techniques, which I then computationally models to enable AI engines to reason in a similar way to humans. I build system that can analyse and recommend representations appropriate for a human and a problem at hand. I combine reasoning with machine learning techniques in order to advance the explainability of AI systems, and apply them to personalised medicine and tutoring systems.
