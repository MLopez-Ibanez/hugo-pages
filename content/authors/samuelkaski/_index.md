Samuel Kaski is a professor of AI in The University of Manchester and
active in setting up the [AI-FUN, Manchester Centre for AI
Fundamentals](https://ai-fun.manchester.ac.uk/). His field is
probabilistic machine learning. He is currently particularly
interested in collaborative machine learning, methods that work well
human experts in the loop in sequential decision making and design
tasks. Such tasks are needed for instance in synthetic biology, drug
design, and more generally experimental design in sciences in
engineering, and inspire interesting machine learning questions
including out-of-distribution generalization, inverse reinforcement
learning, and ad-hoc teamwork with theory of mind.

Sami is UKRI Turing AI World-Leading Researcher Fellow, ELLIS Fellow,
and in his free time professor of Aalto University where half of his
research team is, and leads the Finnish Center for Artificial
Intelligence FCAI and ELLIS Unit Helsinki.

He hopes some day to find time to create an up-to-date webpage. So far
research has been more interesting.
