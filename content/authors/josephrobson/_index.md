Prof Joseph Robson graduated in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge in 1993, and obtained his PhD from the same institution in 1996. Since then he has worked at Cambridge, Swansea, and Manchester universities, and in 2003 was appointed to a Lectureship being promoted to Professor in 2015. Joeâ€™s research interests focus on microstructural evolution and control in industrial alloys, with an emphasis on modelling.

Current work involves the coupling of process and kinetic models, enabling the time and temperature dependence of microstructure to be determined for complex industrial alloys. This is being used to predict microstructure and property evolution for aluminium, magnesium, zirconium alloys and steels during manufacture, forming, and service. Joe also has an interest in microstructural characterization through electron microscopy and in-situ experiments
