My name is Vignesh Gopakumar and I an AI researcher specialising in crafting "explainable" machine learning models that blend known physical laws with real-world data. Currently, I work as an AI Research Scientist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, leading a team that builds actionable surrogate models for exascale simulations and data-driven models for plasma control and reactor design. Additionally, I'm a visiting AI Researcher at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory - STFC, where I contribute to foundational research in making machine learning models more robust and interpretable through physics-based approaches.
