I'm a researcher at UKAEA, the national lab for fusion research. I'm head of the AI & Machine Learning group, and I've worked on many areas of fusion in the past. My interests are of course on various Machine Learning applications, using simulation data as well as experimental data; particularly using AI methods to accelerate conventional simulation solvers. In past roles, I've also worked on advanced-visualisation techniques, experimental data-analysis systems, finite-element methods, and magnetohydrodynamics. I've supervised about half a dozen PhD students and always enjoy these projects, as they give us the opportunity to deep-dive into new, exciting subjects.
