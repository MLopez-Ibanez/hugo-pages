I am a principal scientist at UKAEA and a visiting research fellow at the University of Manchester. My research focuses on the application of machine learning and probabilistic methods to challenging materials science problems. I am particularly interested in the emulation of complex material behaviour and the robust estimation of rare failure events in a fusion reactor. In my spare time I enjoy writing scientific software and have co-developed some widely used simulation toolkits.
