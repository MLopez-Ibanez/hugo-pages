I am lecturer (Assistant Professor) in computer science at The University of Manchester and a member at Centre for AI Fundamentals.

My research concerns artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning and generative models. My current research topics cover large-scale deep reinforcement learning, policy gradient methods, and optimization theory. I am applying these methods to problems in video games, robotics and multi-agent systems.
