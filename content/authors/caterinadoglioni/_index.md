I am a Professor of Particle Physics in the Physics and Astronomy department at the University of Manchester. 

Throughout my career, I have been driven by finding out more about the constituents of matter as well as by the challenges related to the “big science” needed to study them. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN is the perfect scientific environment to combine the two: with my collaborators, we work on the challenges that a data-rich research environment presents for discoveries of rare processes at the ATLAS experiment. 
My focus is real-time analysis, aka analysis done as soon as the data is recorded by the experiment rather than after the data is selected and recorded. This is enabled by research in fast inference methods (in particular unsupervised learning) and hybrid computing architectures. 
I also work on software sustainability, in terms of both energy consumption and [FAIR principles](https://rd-alliance.org/group/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg/outcomes/fair-principles-research-software-fair4rs-0). 
My research is supported by the European Research Council through the Consolidator Grant [REALDARK](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101002463), and I coordinate the [SMARTHEP European Training Network](www.smarthep.org) on real-time analysis for science and industry.
