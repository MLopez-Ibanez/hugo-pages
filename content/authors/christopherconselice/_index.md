Christopher J. Conselice is a Full Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, where he has been on the academic staff since 2020. Conselice is an expert on the properties and evolution of galaxies, and he has researched galaxies from the local universe all the way back to the first galaxies, including the use of new Machine Learning tools.  He latest research is focused on the formation and structural evolution of galaxies.  He is actively planning new space missions for NASA and the European Space Agency.   He is also deeply involved in new `big-dataâ€™ and Machine Learning approaches for uncovering novel ways to study the evolution of galaxies and the universe through the latest astronomical surveys.


Before coming to Manchester, he was a Professor at the University of Nottingham and was a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Caltech and at the Space Telescope Science Institute. Conselice won the Leverhulme Prize in 2009 and in 2018 was awarded a European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Grant to study the first galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).  Conselice also sits on many boards and in leadership positions, including as the lead Legacy Scientist for the ESA Euclid mission.
