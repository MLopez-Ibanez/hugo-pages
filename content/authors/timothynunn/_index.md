Timothy joined the UK Atomic Energy Authority as a Research Software Engineer in 2020. He studied part-time for his undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Warwick.
Tim's current research is computational techniques for design optimisation of Tokamak's (nuclear fusion reactors). Designing critical subsystems, such as toroidal and poloidal magnets, requires optimising over expensive simulations; simultaneously, expert insights from physicists and engineers are incorporated. Active learning, advanced optimisation techniques (such as Bayesian Optimisation), and machine learning are crucial to performing these complex in-silico designs.
