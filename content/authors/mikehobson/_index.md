Professor Michael Hobson is Professor of Astrophysics in the Department of Physics at the University of Cambridge. He is also a Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and was formerly Vice-Master there. He read Natural Sciences (specialising in Theoretical Physics) at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and received his B.A. (Hons) degree in 1989, obtaining a triple first and receiving the Taylor Scholarship and Tripos prize. He remained at Sidney Sussex to complete his Ph.D. in 1992 in the Cavendish Astrophysics Group on the physics of star-formation. Subsequently, as a Research Fellow at Trinity Hall and then an Advanced Fellow of the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, he developed an interest in gravitation and cosmology, in particular the study of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, and developed the Bayesian statistical methods that enabled the first interferometric detection of these fluctuations in 1996. He became a fully tenured member of the Department of Physics in 2000, continuing to pursue research in gravitation, cosmology, Bayesian statistical inference and machine learning, and was made Professor of Astrophysics in 2011. He has published over 400 research papers, which have received over 80,000 citations, placing him in the top 20 most cited physicists in the UK. He is widely regarded as one of the leading authorities worldwide in the development and application of Bayesian statistical methods. He has also published 8 books, which include several widely used textbooks in physics and mathematics.
