Background
The fast development of soft robotics needs new methodology and technology to address the new challenges in engineering design. Moving away from the limitations of rigid structures, it embraces the possibilities offered by soft materials. This shift is not just a change in materials but a reimagining of robotic capabilities and their interaction with diverse environments. Traditional engineering methods, which typically rely on the predictability of hard materials, struggle to effectively predict and manage the behavior of soft materials, especially under varied conditions such as pneumatic actuation. This project aims to address these unique challenges by developing advanced modeling techniques, including differentiable simulation, and applying them to topology optimization in soft robotics.

Project Aims
This PhD project focuses on improving the design process in soft robotics. It aims to develop probabilistic models that can accurately predict the behavior of soft materials. A crucial part of this project is integrating these models into a differentiable simulation framework for topology optimization. This approach enhances traditional probabilistic modeling by creating predictive and adaptable models, allowing for a more efficient and targeted optimization process. The differentiable nature of the simulations is key to finding the best design configurations and the best topological structure to improve the performance and adaptability of soft robotic systems.

Research Methodology
The project combines theoretical development, computational modeling, and experimental work. Initially, it will focus on creating and improving probabilistic models that account for uncertainties in soft material behavior and their response to different loading conditions. These models are unique because of their differentiable nature, making them a vital part of the simulation process for topology optimization. This method will allow for an effective exploration of design options, steering the design process toward the most efficient and practical configurations. Testing these models in advanced soft robotics facilities, such as those in the newly built engineering building (MECD), is essential to ensure they are effective and applicable in real-world situations.
