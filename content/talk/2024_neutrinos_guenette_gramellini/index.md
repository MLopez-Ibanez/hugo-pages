summary: "Neutrinos may hold the key to many great questions of physics and noble element detector technology has transformed the way we study neutrinos by providing very detailed images. Event reconstruction is currently one of the most limiting factors in the physics performances of these detectors and machine learning solutions have shown a lot of promise to significantly improve it. Using a novel pixel readout currently under development at Manchester, new machine learning reconstruction algorithms will be developed to demonstrate the power of 3D imaging in these detectors. "

The elusive neutrinos may hold the key to answering many fundamental questions in physics such as the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Noble element detectors have transformed the field of neutrino physics by offering high granularity electronic images of neutrino events. The 2D images produced by these detectors provide incredibly detailed information about the rare neutrino interactions.  However, a big challenge remains in extracting useful information for physics analyses with traditional algorithms for 2D images: the “reconstruction” of the neutrino interactions is the single limiting factor that hampers event selection efficiencies and background rejection.   

Our group in Manchester is posed to tackle this challenge from two complementary avenues. From a hardware perspective, we are developing a novel pixel technology with a powerful light collection system for future noble element detectors. This technology will offer intrinsic 3D imaging capabilities, thus reducing the ambiguities inherent to traditional 2D images, and providing higher quality information as a starting point for event reconstruction.  
From a software perspective, we are developing new machine learning/artificial intelligence algorithms for 3D imaging that will substitute traditional event reconstruction.  

The use of machine learning to reconstruct, select and identify events has been proven very promising to increase the analysis performances in pixelated readouts compared to traditional 2D readout. For example, [1] reports a notable gain in recognition performance of all type of events relevant to the matter-anti matter asymmetry analysis – notably, a gain of 17% in signal efficiency and 12% in signal purity. Such improvements directly translate into a significant boost in sensitivity to physics beyond the standard model.  

In this project, the student will study the physics capabilities of a pixelated noble element detector for neutrino physics. Given the nature of the detector images, the studies will be performed using pattern recognition algorithms. As a first step, new reconstruction algorithms, using convolutional neural networks will be developed and adapted to the 3D pixel images. Long-short term memory netwroks will also be tested to see if further background reduction can be achieved given the temporal component of the pixel readout.  The algorithms development will leverage real data from the MicroBooNE and NEXT detectors (both noble element detectors). This first stage of the project will lead to publication on the performance of these algorithms. The second step will be to use the newly developed algorithms to study simulated events in a future large pixel detector.  We will focus our study on astrophysical neutrinos, such as neutrinos coming from supernovae and the sun. The goal is to demonstrate that the intrinsic 3D pixel readout offers enhanced performances. We expect this work to lead to a second publication on the physics potential of a pixel detector to study astrophysical neutrinos.  The final step of this project will include the scintillation light information to the 3D images to increase the energy resolution and to lower the event detection threshold. The light readout also produces patterns that can be more efficiently reconstructed using neural networks. The new algorithms dedicated to the reconstruction of the light will complement the ones for 3D images. This work will lead to a novel, 4D event reconstruction method that is expected to make significant advances in the physics reach of a future pixelated detector with a powerful light detection system.
