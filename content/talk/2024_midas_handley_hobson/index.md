summary: "MIDAS is a generation-after-next method for theoretically complete Bayesian reasoning and decisionmaking, offering an interpretable & explainable decision at high-performance computing prices. This project aims to bring down these costs to be applied to real-time human-in-the-loop decisionmaking, working with industrial partners PolyChord Ltd and DSTL."

Bayesian inference is a theoretical and practical framework for encapsulating knowledge using probability. These probability distributions are updated as information is acquired and degraded, and the current state of knowledge can be used to quantitatively determine strategies for acquiring new data. MIDAS is a theoretical and computational system that has been developed over the past three years in collaboration with [DSTL] and [PolyChord Ltd], advancing the well-established theory of Bayesian experimental design to incorporate the cutting edge of Bayesian numerical inference. One of the recent success has been a mapping of this procedure onto the [OODA loop], giving a quantitative Bayesian interpretation of this established decisionmaking process.  At the present, MIDAS is a "generation-after-next" method for theoretically complete Bayesian reasoning and decisionmaking, offering an interpretable & explainable decision at high-performance computing prices. This project aims to bring down these costs to be applied to real-time human-in-the-loop decisionmaking.

At the core of this approach lies a tight coupling between Bayes Theorem (quantifying how to update incomplete knowledge in in light of uncertain data) and the Kullbackâ€“Liebler divergence (which quantifies the amount of Shannon information provided by a given update). Whilst this theory has been established in the field of Bayesian experimental design, the unique edge of the MIDAS approach is that we now have a unique combination of Bayesian tools (nested sampling [2205.15570], Evidence networks [2305.11241] and nonlinear optimisation [2101.04525]) capable of deploying these techniques without analytic compromise.

The PhD will begin with projects applying the existing tools to simple and realistic simulated problems, comparing and contrasting results from the MIDAS approach with more traditional reinforcement learning and active learning techniques. This will then be extended to adversarial problems of interest, examining how strategies differ when one or both players use a MIDAS approach. In parallel, we will bring in ongoing developments in emulation and simulation based inference in from within and beyond the group. The theoretical side of the project will develop the element of Human-in-the-loop decisionmaking, generalising the techniques of optimal data acquisition to optimal data presentation.

Throughout the project, there will be opportunity to work with industrial partners DSTL, PAConsulting and PolyChord Ltd, who will provide real-world problems of interest and computational tools essential to the project.
