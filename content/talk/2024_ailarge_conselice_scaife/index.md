summary: "The next decade in astrophysics presents a monumental challenge where we have to decipher vast data from new telescopes, vastly surpassing existing astronomical data set sizes. The Euclid Space Telescope, launched in July 2023, will generate a massive datasets, necessitating AI-driven decisions in scientific analyses, a trend which will continue going into SKA.  This PhD project aims to carry out object classification and to leverage new AI tools to unravel galaxy formation processes and predict features. Combining astronomy and machine learning expertise, this project will develop probabilistic methods to explore new parameter spaces, pushing scientific discovery and methods. This new initiative will address challenges in astronomical datasets, offering potential for breakthroughs and the  discoveries of anomalous objects that often leads to new physics. The PhD student involved will become an ML expert, whose work could impact many different areas beyond astronomy. The project, designed for collaboration within the CDT will be a test-bed for larger surveys like SKA, providing a head start for even larger future data analyses.

One of the pivotal challenges in astrophysics for the next decade and onward will be deciphering the enormous influx of data from new space and ground-based telescopes, surpassing the complexity of all existing astronomical data several times over. For scientific projects that produce huge data volumes, often referred to as "big science" (e.g., SKA, CERN), AI-driven decisions are increasingly necessary to replace human decisions at multiple points within scientific analyses. 
The Euclid Space Telescope (launched in July 2023) is set to obtain imaging for hundreds of millions of objects and is the most recent telescope which underscores this challenge and one of many that leads to the SKA.  Data from Euclid is now being taken and soon will exceed the ability of nearly all current methods of analysis.  Thus, new machine learning tools within the decision-making framework, classifying objects—galaxies, stars, quasar,  image defects, among many others will soon be needed.

Our objectives in this PhD project within the  AI CDT extends beyond just classification. We aim to leverage this information to unravel galaxy formation processes and predict the features of real objects - stars, galaxies, etc.. The proposed interdisciplinary project merges Manchester's expertise in astronomy and machine learning in a new way. As part of this, we will develop leading-edge probabilistic machine learning methods, leveraging uncertainty in a statistical manner to drive the exploration of new parameter spaces and promote scientific discovery. 

Previously, supervised and unsupervised ML on galaxy images has led to the discovery of unique galaxy classes previously unidentified. We are delving into the optimal utilization of methods like VQ-VAE for both training and discovering the composition of galaxies.  However, this is just the start as other ML tools need to be applied to this problem, for which a PhD working in this CDT will do.   While ML approaches in astronomy have traditionally utilized single-band imaging, we are pioneering the use of richer datasets, including multi-wavelength imaging and quantized features of galaxies based on the Euclid data.   This project addresses challenges posed by astronomical datasets as a way to both develop AI systems for other areas in society and business  as well as for making scientific discoveries. 

Beyond classification, our project offers the potential to make discoveries of anomalous or unknown objects, presenting opportunities for new physics. Astronomy is replete with serendipitous discoveries, and ML can automate the identification of rare objects, potentially leading to breakthroughs.

The PhD student working on this at Manchester within the CDT will lead this initiative, becoming an expert in cutting-edge ML applications on astronomical data. As ML permeates increasingly all areas of society, this extensive training will enable the student to make a lasting impact throughout their career.  This project is perfectly designed for the PhD student to work with and collaborate with others in the CDT from Manchester and Cambridge.  

The project's inception involves collecting and applying machine learning basics to astronomical Euclid imaging and spectroscopic data, addressing challenges posed by datasets that would take centuries to analyze conventionally. The student will lead an interdisciplinary initiative,  inventing new analytical ML tools to classify and measure properties of objects we are starting to find within the Euclid observations.   Euclid is the first time that a large data set will be analysed primarily with ML tools, and thus it is a test-bed for even larger surveys such as SKA, which will dominate the work we will do at Manchester for the next ~20 years.  There is also significant overlap between the Euclid and SKA sky converge, and thus starting this ML examination now will give us a head start in producing the tools needed to make the most of the SKA data when it arrives.
